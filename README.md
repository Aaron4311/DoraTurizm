- **Entity Framework Core**: Provides a powerful ORM for database operations.

## Technologies Used

| Technology                    | Description                                                                                                  |
|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **ASP.NET Core MVC**          | Utilizes the Model-View-Controller pattern for handling user interface and business logic.                   |
| **Entity Framework Core**      | Offers Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) for seamless database interactions.                                  |
| **JWT Authentication**        | Provides secure session management with access and refresh tokens.                                           |
| **Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP)** | Handles cross-cutting concerns like security and error logging in a centralized way.             |
| **Multi-Layered Architecture** | Enables modular, maintainable code by separating concerns into distinct layers.                          |
| **Autofac**                    | Used for dependency injection and resolving dependencies across different layers in the application.          |
| **FluentValidation**           | Provides a fluent interface for defining validation rules for models and entities.                           |

## Project Architecture

The project follows a multi-layered architecture, ensuring separation of concerns and a clean code structure. The main layers are:

- **WebUI MVC**: The user interface layer, built using ASP.NET Core MVC, handles client-side interactions and displays data to the user.
- **WebAPI**: A set of RESTful APIs exposed for communication between the front end and backend services.
- **Business Layer**: Contains the core business logic and application-specific rules.
- **Core Layer**: Houses common utilities, constants, and shared resources used across other layers.
- **DataAccess Layer**: Responsible for interacting with the database, utilizing Entity Framework Core for ORM functionality.
- **Entity Layer**: Contains data models and entities that represent the database structure, used by the DataAccess layer.
